```{r,eval=FALSE}
"Omit the result"
dim(mtcars)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
"Omit the code block and only returnt the result"
"Helpful for plots (no code)"
dim(mtcars)
```

Inline code looks like this: Two plus two equals `r 2+2`

```{r}
"insert a code chunk with Ctrl+Alt+I"
```

```{python, echo=FALSE}
adjust = "adjust the coding language by replacing the R with python"
print(adjust)
```

```{r}
fake_letters <- letters[1:10]
```

```{r}
py$adjust
```
```{python}
print(r.fake_letters)
```
